/*
    LOGAPI-W29 — Test Compliance Suite

    Responsibility:
        Define Log Level API compliance assertions, test case descriptors,
        compliance dimensions/outcomes/severity, negative compliance catalog,
        compliance suite report, and production-hardening test readiness views.

    Boundary:
        This wave defines test/compliance descriptors only.
        It does not implement CI, a test runner, logging backend, telemetry,
        persistence, recovery, policy assignment, circulation engine, bridge
        orchestration, or receiver behavior.

    Doctrine:
        Compliance proves boundary discipline:
        configure first, consume content only, no per-call config, no premature
        policy assignment, no circulation internals, no bridge orchestration.
